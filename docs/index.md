# Agent007: The A* Scholar Status Report

## A hero's journey

Agent 007 needs to provide for his family. Unfortunately he can only stand the toxcity levels in his resourse grounds for so long before he must exit. Agent 007 needs to pick up as many high value items in the resource grounds as possible. There are also  dangers such as pitfalls he must avoid.

## Smarten Up!

Agent 007 always begins his journey in the same spot. Since he knows he only has a certain amount of time to act, the items close to him with value catch his eye more than high item values in the distance. Also, clusters of item locations are ignored (each item is scored on a static hueristic so good clusters of high value targets are not accounted for). On top of this, there are trap spots the agent is unaware of that will eat up some of his score (he will not know about these spots until he has hit them). How does Agent 007 get smart and deal with these circumstances? Check out our status report!
