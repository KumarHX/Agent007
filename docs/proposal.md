## Proposal


## Summary of the Project
This project aims to use AI/ML algorithms to find materials in the map and craft items based on user input using NLP. For example, there are various areas such as forest, water, lava that hold different types of predefined resources. If the user input command, “craft a wooden sword,” then the AI will find the area in the map that has access to the resources which are required to craft this item. 

The different areas in the map will have a surface of a specific type of material (ie. forest may have grass blocks, water may have sand blocks etc). 



## AI/ML Algorithms
Reinforcement Learning - Q-Learning  
Q-learning finds a policy which is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the expected value of the total reward over any and all successive steps, starting from the current state.
We assign positive rewards for finding the correct geographical location and retrieving the required resources as specified by the user. 

## Evaluation Plan
The AI’s performance will be evaluated based on the success to find materials and craft items. The idea is that after multiple iterations the program will be able to devise an optimal path based on the specifications of the map, find resources and craft items based on user input. Positive points will be assigned to an AI for reaching goal terrains and finding the necessary resources, negative points will be assigned for navigating to areas that are not goal terrains, leaving goal terrains before finding all the materials required, spending to much time in goal terrains and not crafting when applicable.
