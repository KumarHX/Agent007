## Proposal


## Summary of the Project
This project aims to use AI/ML algorithms to find materials in the map and craft items based on user input using NLP. For example, there are various areas such as forest, water, lava, ...etc that hold different types of predefined resources. If the system gets a command, “craft a wooden sword,” then the AI will find the area in the map that has access to the resources required to build this item and craft it. 

The different areas in the map will have a surface of a specific type of material (ie. forest may have grass blocks, water may have sand blocks) and specific resources will be help in specific areas (ie. wood in forest area). 



## AI/ML Algorithms
Reinforcement Learning - Q-Learning  
Q-learning finds a policy that is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the expected value of the total reward over any and all successive steps, starting from the current state.
We assign positive rewards to finding the correct geographical location and retrieving the required resources as specified by the user. 

## Evaluation Plan
The AI’s performance will be evaluated based on success to find materials and craft items being asked.
