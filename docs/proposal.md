## Proposal


## Summary of the Project
Utilizing search algorithms and learning search hueristics to avoid dangers on a flat map and pick up as many high value items as possible given a certain amount of time.


## AI/ML Algorithms
Learning Search Hueristic: An Experience Graph GE is essentially a collection of previously planned paths. The E-graph planner uses weighted A* to search the original search space G

## Evaluation Plan
The AIâ€™s performance will be evaluated based on the success to find high value items and avoid dangers in a limited amount of time.
